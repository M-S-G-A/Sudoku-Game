# Sudoku-Game
Recently, I developed a Sudoku Classic game in C. 

All you need to do is to run the "Sudoku.c" program.

There are 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard.

In Easy mode, the player has up to 5 lives.
In Medium, 3 lives.
Hard, 2 lives.

You have to enter the x and y coordinates of the cell of you wish to access, then fill it.

Anyway, you can select 'How to Play' in the main menu to obtain further details on how to play.

Have fun!!
